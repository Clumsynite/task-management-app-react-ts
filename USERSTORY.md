# Building a Task Management App with Drag-and-Drop.

## Introduction
 You are tasked with creating a basic task management application using React. The application should allow users to add tasks, organize them into different categories(Added, Started, Completed), and implement drag-and-drop functionality to reorder tasks within each category.

## Requirements:

### Code Structuring:
Organize your project into appropriate directories and files.
Implement a clear folder structure for components, styles, and task-related code.
Follow a consistent naming convention.

### Optimization:
Implement drag-and-drop functionality efficiently.
Minimize unnecessary re-renders
Use React functional components and hooks.
Implement drag-and-drop functionality using a library like react-beautiful-dnd.

### Responsibility Division:
Divide your application into appropriate components (e.g., TaskList, TaskItem, TaskForm).
Ensure that each component has a single responsibility.

### Architecture:
Define a clear architecture for your application (e.g., parent-child component structure).
Use props for data flow between components.
Implement category-based organization for tasks.

### Data Flow:
Ensure a unidirectional data flow within the application.
Utilize local state to manage task data.
Implement the ability to move tasks between categories via drag-and-drop.

### Data Storage:
Store task data in local state.
Implement basic client-side storage for user's task data (e.g., using browser local storage).

### Latest Tools and Libraries:
Use the latest stable version of React.
Implement styling using CSS or a CSS-in-JS solution.

### Bonus:
Visualize the tasks in a graph as per their due date.
Implement task prioritization (e.g., high, medium, low).
Add animations for drag-and-drop interactions.

## Submission 
 Candidates should submit their code in a GitHub repository. Include a README.md file with instructions on how to run the application and any additional notes. Also attach screenshots of the designed product.

## Evaluation:
 Candidates will be evaluated based on code quality, adherence to best practices, and overall application functionality. Attention to detail, user experience, and performance optimizations will be considered in the evaluation.
