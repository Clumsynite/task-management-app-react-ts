## Getting Started

To get started with the Task Management App, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using your preferred method. For example, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clumsynite/task-management-app-react-ts.git
cd ./task-management-app-react-ts
```


2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the cloned repository's directory and install the required dependencies using a package manager like npm or yarn. Run one of the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

3. **Customize** Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS allows you to customize various aspects of the framework. Open the `tailwind.config.js` file and modify the configuration to suit your needs. You can adjust colors, breakpoints, font sizes, and more.

4. **Development Workflow**: The repository is set up with Vite, which provides a fast development server and hot module replacement. Start the development server with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser. You can make changes to the code, and the application will automatically reload.

5. **Build for Production**: When you're ready to deploy your application, build the optimized production version. Use one of the following commands:


```bash
npm run build
```

or

```bash
yarn build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the optimized and minified production build of your application.

6. **Start Developing**: Now you can start developing your React application! Create new components, modify existing ones, and utilize the utility classes provided by Tailwind CSS to rapidly build your UI.
